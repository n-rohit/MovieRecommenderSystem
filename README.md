# RecommenderSystem
Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the “rating” or “preference” of a user towards a domain-specific item or item. This is a Movie Recommendation system that uses <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=k-nearest+neighbors+algorithm&rlz=1C1RXQR_enIN995IN995&oq=k-nearest+neighbors+algorithm&aqs=chrome..69i57.553j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm</a>(KNN).

In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie, therefore the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.
