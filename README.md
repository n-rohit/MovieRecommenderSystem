# RecommenderSystem
Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the “rating” or “preference” of a user towards a domain-specific item or item. This is a Movie Recommendation system that uses KNN Algorithm.

In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie, therefore the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.
